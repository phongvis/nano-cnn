# nano-cnn
A Convolutional Neural Network project for Deep Learning Nanodegree at udacity.

There is a folder for practice implementation from the course lectures and a folder for the project. As the model needs to be trained using GPU, I work directly in udaicy workspace. The `dog_app.ipynb` file here is just a download from the workspace.
